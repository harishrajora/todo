This project welcomes developers of all skill levels, and this guide will help you get started smoothly

## Prerequisites 

Before contributing, please ensure you have:

- Git installed

- Node.js + npm installed (for the frontend)

- Python 3.x installed (for the backend)

- A GitHub account

If you're new to any of these, don’t worry -the steps below walk you through everything.

## Fork The Repository 

Click the Fork button at the top of the repository.  
This creates your copy that you can safely experiment with.

## Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/traitor09/todo.git
cd todo
```
## Create a new Branch
Always make changes in a separate branch instead of main.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```


Use clear branch names:

`feature/...` for new features  
`fix/...` for bug fixes  
`docs/...` for documentation  
`refactor/...` for improvements

## Setting Up Project Locally 
### Frontend

Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now be running locally.

### Backend

Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

- **Linux/macOS**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows (PowerShell)**
  ```powershell
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

- **Windows (CMD)**
  ```cmd
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```

## Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup Environment Variables

```bash
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
MONGO_DB_NAME=<your_database_name>
```
#### *Replace <your_mongodb_connection_string> and <your_database_name> with your actual MongoDB URI and database name.
## Set up the database:

```bash
python setup_database.py
```

## Run the backend server:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Ensure
While contributing, please:

- Keep code clean and well-commented
- Follow existing coding style
- Test your changes locally
- Make commits small and meaningful

Example commit message:

git commit -m "Clear and descriptive message"
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```
